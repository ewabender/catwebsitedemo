            <p> Tortoiseshell and calico coats result from an interaction between genetic and developmental factors. The primary gene for coat color (B), for the colors brown, chocolate, cinnamon, etc., can be masked by the co-dominant gene for the orange color (O), which is on the X chromosome and has two alleles: orange (XO) and not-orange (Xo) that produce orange phaeomelanin and black eumelanin pigments, respectively. Typically, the alleles are notated as an uppercase O for orange, or a lowercase o for not-orange. Tortoiseshell and calico cats are labeled XOXo, indicating O-gene heterozygosity. The (B) and (O) genes can be further modified by a recessive dilute gene (dd) which softens the colors. Orange becomes cream, black becomes gray, etc. Various terms are used for specific colors, for example, gray is also called blue, orange is also called ginger. Therefore, a tortoiseshell cat may be a chocolate tortoiseshell or a blue/cream tortoiseshell or the like, based on the alleles for the (B) and (D) genes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat" class="anchor">More info on the tortie</a>  </p>

                The Siamese cat (Thai: แมวไทย, Maeo Thai; แมวสยาม, Maeo Sayam) is one of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat. It derives from the Wichianmat landrace. The Siamese cat is one of several varieties of cats native to Thailand (known as Siam before 1939). The original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. Siamese cats have a distinctive colourpoint coat, resulting from a temperature-sensitive type of albinism.Distinct features like blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an elongated, slender, and muscular body, and various forms of point colouration characterise the modern-style Siamese. The modern-style Siamese's point-colouration resembles the "old-style" foundation stock. The "old-style" Siamese have a round head and body. They have been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat. Siamese and Thai cats are selectively bred and pedigreed in multiple cat fancier and breeder organisations. The terms "Siamese" or "Thai" are used for cats from this specific breed, which are by definition all purebred cats with a known and formally registered ancestry. The ancestry registration is the cat's pedigree or "paperwork". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_cat" class="anchor"> More info on the siamase</a>

                The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name Ragdoll is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.he breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

                Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats", due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets. Ragdolls are distinguishable by their pointed coloration (where the body is lighter than the face, ears, legs, and tail), large round blue eyes, soft, thick coats, thick limbs, long tails, and soft bodies. Their color rings are commonly tricolor or bicolor. The breed was developed in Riverside, California, by breeder Ann Baker. In 1963, a regular, non-pedigreed, white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll" class="anchor"> More info on ragdolls</a>
